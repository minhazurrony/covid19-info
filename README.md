- Then ``` yarn ``` to install all the packages required to run this app.
- Then run ```yarn start``` to start this app locally.

### Technologies used:
- ReactJS library for building single page application.
- Ant Design for UI Layout and UI Components.
- Axios for fetching data.
- Day.js for formating date and time.
- TypeScript for maintaining better codebase.


### What I learned:
- Fetch external data from an API endpoint and apply ComponentDidMount() life cycle method to a functional component by using useEffect() hooks.
- Maintain local state using useState() hooks and update those state as per need.
- This is totally a replacement of class based component to functional component using necessary hooks to achieve more flexibility.
- Extend my knowledge about conditional rendering.
- Get clear idea about how to build a layout using Ant Design components and achieve more user accessible UI by making them more responsive for all kind of devices.
